     <h1>The Best Movies according to Bede</h1>
 <h2>My Top 4 Movies of All Time</h2>
 <hr />

 <p>Maybe not of all time, But these are 4 great movies I have enjoyed.</p>

 <h3>Spider Man</h3>
 <p> This makes my list beacause, growing up, spiderman was one of the marvels superhero movies i enjoyed watching a lot. also i actuall thought i could be spider man, haha. I might not be able to spin any web but i'm on the web. haha, I hope you get that? </p>

 <hr />

 <h3>Merlin</h3>
 <p>Who doesnt like the boy whose shoulders the whole world rests on. I loved the movie series, Merlin, because it captured every emotion you can look for in an epic movie mixed with magic, beautiful maidens, haha.. and yes, a very good story line</p>

 <hr />

 <h3>Game Of Thrones</h3>
 <p>Best of the best, this movie series makes my list because it really draws the viewer in emotionally, mentally, physically and just about any 'ally you can think of. My favorite character? The dragon, haha!! Over all this was an awesome movie from the first episode to the end. Fun parts: I like how Jeofrey died, it could have been worse tho, but i'm fine with how he died. Second the bolton guy, could have died in worse terms but I'm fine with feeding him to his dogs, haha!!</p>

 <h3>Naruto</h3>
 <p>Its funny cos I didn't like Naruto at first. In fact I didnt love animes much. But everything changed when I first played the shippuden game on playstation. This is a complete anime with just the perfect story line and character development. it was lon but i loved it because you get attached to the story line and characters on a deep level. Naruto also had good animation to go with the storyline. It had nice power displays and fighting combo.</p>
